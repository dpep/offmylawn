Hey Daniel, it’s Tennessee State Representative Justin J. Pearson.

I’m reaching out today before the new year to ask for your help in reaching our end of year fundraising goal.

This year, we saw lawmakers in state houses across the country undermine the principles upon which our country was founded.

We saw the Tennessee general assembly become the battleground for issues that have a direct impact on everyday Americans.

And along the way, you have been with me. In power, in prayer and in your support of our campaigns. Like prayer, People Power changes things! For all of this, I say thank you.

But there’s far too much on the line in 2024 for us to pull back now. We know how important elections are. We also know if we keep our momentum, we’ll be able to compete and win.

And when People Power wins – democracy wins.

We can’t be caught off guard by whatever the opposition throws our way between now and Election Day. And reaching our end of year goal is the best way to ensure we’re ready for anything in this race. Click here to contribute an end of year contribution >> jjpfortn.us/eoysms?t=UXm2Co
